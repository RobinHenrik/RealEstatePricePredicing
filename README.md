## Motivation & Goal
Understanding apartment prices and predicting their values is crucial for buyers, sellers, and investors. This project aims to:
- Build a predictive model for apartment prices in Estonia.
- Identify the key factors influencing property prices.
- Detect undervalued properties to aid investment decisions.

## Repository Contents

1. **Data**
   - `listings_data.csv`: The dataset scraped from kv.ee.

2. **Notebooks**
   - `RealEstatePricePrediction.ipynb`: The notebook for cleaning the data and training the model.

3. **Model**
   - `Model.md`: Contains a link to download a trained model. The model can then be loaded in to the notebook and doesn't need to be trained again.
  
4. **README.md**
   - Instructions for replicating the analysis and an overview of the repository structure.

5. **Scraper.md**
   - Link to the scrapers repository.
